Delve a little deeper, do some research, and find out what do the following mean:

`public` - Access modifier - makes it globally available unlike `private`
`class` - to declare a class
`static` - a static method can be invoked without instantiating the class like `main`
`void` - a method which does not return anything
`main` - the main method which will be executed, each class has to have one
`System` - class name
`out` - instance of the System class
`println` - prints a new line to the console
